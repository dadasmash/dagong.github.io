### _**Formation and Evolution of Beliefs: Famine Experience and Trust in Neighbors**_ <br>
(with Zhian Hu and Chuanchuan Zhang) (draft coming soon)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
This paper examines how a traumatic experience across differential cultural configurations,
can shed light on norms of risk sharing and community cultural persistence, in the context
of Great Chinese Famine (1959-1961). We use cross mortality-clan-cohort variations and a
difference-in-difference-in-differences method to study the evolution of clan culture values in
the wake of the Famine. Our fnding documents that the famine exposed cohort that live
in a stronger clan county report higher level of trust in their clan members, relative to the
people who didn't perceive a sever famine. Our fnding are robust to a set of placebo tests
and robustness check. The results remain stable for dynamic effects models. This paper
contributes to literature on the effects on traumatic experience by focusing on a particular
aspect, i.e., the formation and evolution of personal belief.

<br>
We study the effect of China’s anti-contagious policy on labor market outcomes in 2020.
By exploiting variation in the duration of the zero-Covid policy in China, which is triggered by
the outbreak of new cases of COVID-19 in a 14-day observation window, we find that a 10%
increase (3.7 days in average) in the duration of the zero-Covid policy caused the probability of
unemployment to increase by around 0.1. Unlike most large economies that suffered a serious
health shock from the COVID-19 pandemic, China effectively contained the scale and the
spread of the initial outbreak in 2020. This provides a special empirical setting to examine
the policy effect of anti-contagious policies, and we show that the disruption on the labor
market majorly comes from the zero-Covid containment measures, while health shocks are
trivial on the labor market outcomes. Moreover, the zero-Covid policy decreases the labor
income and hours worked for employed individuals, and the policy effect is heterogeneous
across demographic groups. We also examined the policy effect during different phases of
the pandemic, and the results imply that the stringent clearance during the first stage of
the pandemic (ended by Feb 17, 2020) caused the negative impacts on the labor outcomes,
while the subsequent dynamic clearance strategy did not generate significant disruption on
the labor market outcomes in 2020.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Gethin, Martínez-Toledano and Piketty (2022) analyze the long-run evolution of political cleavages using a new database on socioeconomic determinants of voting from approximately 300 elections in 21 Western democracies between 1948 and 2020. They find that, in the 1950s and 1960s, voting for the “left” was associated with lower-educated and low-income voters. After that, voting for the “left” has gradually become associated with higher-educated voters, while high-income voters have continued to vote for the “right”. In the 2010s, there is a disconnection between the effects of income and education on voting. In this replication, we first conduct a computational reproduction, using the replication package provided by the authors. Second, we do a robustness replication testing to what extent the original results are robust to i) restricting the sample to “core” left and right parties, ii) analyzing the top 80% versus bottom 20%, iii) weighting by population, iv) dropping control variables, and v) using country fixed effects. The main results of the paper are found to be largely replicable and robust.
